I am a currently a postdoc at <a href = "https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/">SIERRA</a>-team, <a href = "https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-paris-centre"> INRIA Paris</a>, working with <a href = "https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/"> Michael I. Jordan</a>. I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science at Peking University, where I was advised by [Xiaotie Deng](https://dblp.org/pid/d/XiaotieDeng.html). I obtained my bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics from Hua Luogeng Honors Class, Beihang University. 
      
My current research interest lies in 
<!-- the intersection between economics and computation.  -->
      <!-- In particular, I focus on  -->
      the learning and game theoretic issues in the interaction of strategic and learning agents and how each field can help the other to have better practical implication. For example, I am interested in how to learn players' private information from equilibria and how strategic agents can utilize their information advantage to gain profit from interaction. 
      
During my PhD, I visited [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/) at the University of Hong Kong from Feb. to Aug. 2023, and from Aug. to Sept. 2024. I worked as an intern at Alimama group from May. to Sept. 2024 on online ad auctions.
